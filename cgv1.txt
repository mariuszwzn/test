Git:

Rule:
use first and last name in git commits instead of Windows ID, add email address
Reason: 
with the first and last name, the author can be found faster than by the id
Example:
git config --global user.email "john.smith@company.com"
git config --global user.name "John Smith"


Rule:
add the jira ticket number in each commit (in prefix)
Reason:
- entering the jira ticket number acts as documentation of the change
- allows to determine the business reason for which the code was created
- in the case of github integration with jira it is possible to previewing commited changes direct in jira task

Example:
git commit -m "JIRA-123456 Commit message"


Rule:
add type of change (feature, hotfix) as a folder in each new branch
Reason:
Hierarchical branch folders are an effective way to keep the repository clean and organized.
All temporary branches (branches which can be deleted after merging) should be stored in folders, all permanent branches (e.g. master) should be placed without folders.

Example:
git checkout -b feature/JIRA-123456
git checkout -b hotfix/JIRA-123456

Rule:
delete feature branch after merging with the target branch

Reason:
Removing merged branches keeps the repository clean.
Example:
git push origin --delete feature/JIRA-123456


Rule:
do not commit directly to the target branch.
Reason:
All changes must be approved by the reviewers during PR checking

Rule:
(In the case of more than one commit in the branch) Don't rebase your commits from feature branch to the master branch
Reason:
Performing a rebase makes it very difficult to track the history of changes in the target branches.
In the case of rebasing a branch with a significant number of commits, it becomes difficult to roll back the changes.




Formatting and Indentation: 
- the code should be written in a standardized format,
